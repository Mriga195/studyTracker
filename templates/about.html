                <h2>What is Pomodoro Studying?</h2>
                <p>Pomodoro studying is a technique developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It's a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The technique is named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer (pomodoro means "tomato" in Italian) that Cirillo used as a university student.</p>
